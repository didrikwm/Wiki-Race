# Wiki-Race
Find the shortest path between two Wikipedia articles, using web scraping with Beautiful Soup, RegEx and multi-threading.

## Prerequisites
Python (at least 3.8) is installed.

RegEx is installed.

Beautiful Soup 4 is installed.

## Notes
 
The package is intended to be installed and run on a Linux computer.

This was an assignment for the course IN3110 at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo, completed in the spring of 2021.

## Functionality
The program lets you enter the links to two Wikipedia articles, and it finds the shortest path between them.

## Missing functionality
There is little to no error handling. This is something I could implement, but since the assignment text does not mention it at all, I figured it was not required.

## Usage
The program can be started by running `python wiki_race.py`.
